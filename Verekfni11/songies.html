      <p>[Verse 1: Woosung, Dojoon]<br>
      Do you hear me?<br>
      A gloomy day covered in gray fog<br>
      I'm afraid I'm blind now<br>
      I've lost interest in everything<br>
      Do you hear me?<br>
      As I walked down the street<br>
      I looked in a different way and there was no one there<br>
      The dreams I chased after follow me, oh woah<br></p>
      
      <p>[Pre-Chorus: Woosung]<br>
      I'm dying inside<br>
      I wanna think that it's a lie, why? Why?<br>
      Even if I shout, there is no answer<br>
      A flood of loneliness<br>
      In the rain, rain, rain<br></p>
      
      <p>[Chorus: Woosung]<br>
      She's in the rain<br>
      When I look at how beautiful you are, time stops<br>
      It's hard to even open my eyes now<br>
      No, woah, she's in the rain<br></p>
      
      <p>[Verse 2: Dojoon]<br>
      Do you hear me?<br>
      Even if you're hurt, you don't show it<br>
      I'm so scared of seeing the end<br>
      In your eyes I can see the emptiness<br></p>
      
      <p>[Pre-Chorus: Woosung]<br>
      She's dying inside<br>
      She wants to think that it's a lie, why? Why?<br>
      Even if I call her, there is no <br>
      A shower of rain<br>
      In the rain, rain, rain<br></p>
      
      <p>[Chorus: Dojoon]<br>
      She's in the rain<br>
      When I look at how beautiful you are, time stops<br>
      It’s hard to even open my eyes now<br>
      No, woah, she's in the rain<br></p>
      
      <p>[Bridge: Dojoon]<br>
      In my memory your traces spread<br>
      As if the rain has soaked them up<br>
      I lose track of where to go<br>
      In your tears of frozen reality<br></p>
      
      <p>[Interlude: Woosung]<br>
      She's in the rain<br>
      You wanna hurt yourself, I'll stay with you<br>
      You wanna make yourself go through the pain<br>
      It's better to be held than holding on, no, woah<br></p>
      
      <p>[Chorus: Woosung & Dojoon, Woosung]<br>
      We're in the rain<br>
      In this falling rain<br>
      I fill the scattered you<br>
      So I could see how beautiful you are<br>
      No, woah, we're in the rain<br></p></lyrics>
